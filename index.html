        <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">Mount Erebus is an active volcano, the second-highest in Antarctica (after Mount Sidley) and the southernmost active volcano on Earth. It is the sixth-highest ultra mountain on the continent.[1] With a summit elevation of 3,794 metres (12,448 ft), it is located in the Ross Dependency on Ross Island, which is also home to three inactive volcanoes: Mount Terror, Mount Bird, and Mount Terra Nova. The volcano has been active since about 1.3 million years ago and has a long-lived lava lake in its inner summit crater that has been present since at least the early 1970s.The volcano was the site of the Air New Zealand Flight 901 accident, which occurred in November 1979. - <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Erebus" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></cite></p>
